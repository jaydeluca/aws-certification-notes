# Elastic Beanstalk 101
## What is Elastic Beanstalk
**Elastic Beanstalk** is a service for deploying and scaling web applications developed in many popular languages: Java, .NET, PHP, NodeJS, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker onto widely used application server platforms like Apache Tomcat, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

Developers can focus on writing code and don't need to worry  about any of the underlying infrastructure needed to run the application.

You upload the code and Elastic Beanstalk will handle deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling and application health.

You retain full control of the underlying AWS resources powering your application and you pay only for the AWS resources required to store and run your application (e..g. EC2 instances and S3 buckets)
