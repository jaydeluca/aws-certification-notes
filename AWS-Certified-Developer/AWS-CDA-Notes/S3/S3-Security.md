# S3 Security
##Securing Your Buckets
- By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE
- You can setup up access control to your buckets using:
    - Bucket Policies - Applied at a bucket level
    - Access Control Lists - Applied at an object leve
- S3 Buckets can be configured to create access logs, which log al requests made to the S3 bucket. These logs can be written to another bucket
