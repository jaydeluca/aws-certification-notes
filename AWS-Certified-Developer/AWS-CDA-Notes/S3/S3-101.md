# S3 101
Simple Storage Service - S3

S3 provides developers and IT teams with secure, durable, highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use, with a simple web services interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.

- S3 is a safe place to store your files
- It is Object-based storage
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities

## S3 - The Basics
- S3 is object-based -i.e. allows you to upload files
- Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB
- There is unlimited storage
- Files are stored in Buckets (similar to a folder)
- S3 is a universal namespace. That means names must be unique globally
    - Example: https://s3-us-east1-1.amazonaws.com/tier3aws
- When you upload a file to S3, you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful

# Data Consistency Model for S3
- Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new objects (Soon as you upload your file its available to read)
- Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take time to propogate - update or delete a file can take some time to propoage)
- S3 is Object based. Objects consist of the following:
    - Key (This is simply the name of the object)
    - Value (This is simply the data, which is made up of a sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (Important for versioning)
    - Metadata (Data about the data your are storing)
    - Subresources - bucket-specific configuration:
        - Bucket Policies, Access Control Lists
        - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
        - Transfer Acceleration
        
# S3 - The Basics
- Built for 99.99% availability for the S3 platform
- Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability
- Amazon guarantees 99.99999999% durability for S3 information (Remember 11 x 9s)
- Tier Storage Available
- Lifecycle Management
- Versioning
- Encryption
- Secure your data - Access

# S3 - Storage Tiers/Classes
- S3: 99.99% availability, 99.99999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities, and is designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.
- S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed): For data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Lower fee than 23, but you are charged a retrieval fee.
- S3-One Zone IA: Same as IA however data is stored in a asingle Availability Zone only, still 99.99999999% durability, but only 99.5% availability. Cost is 20% less than regular S3 - IA
- Reduced Redundancy Storage: Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year. Use for data that can be recreated if lost, e.g. thumbnails (Starting to disappear from AWS documentation but may still feature in exam) **Amazon is now recommending that you do not use this storage class**
- GlacierL: Very cheap, but used for archival only. Optimaised for data that is infrequently accessed and it takes 3-5 hours to restore from Glacier

# S3 - Charges
- Charged for:
    - Storage per GB
    - Requests (GET, PUT, COPY, etc)
    - Storage Management Pricing
        - Inventory, Analytics, and Object tags
    - Data Management Pricing
        - Data transferred out of S3
    - Transfer Acceleration
        - Use of Cloudfront to optimize transfers
        
 
 # S3 - Exam Tips
 - Remember that S3 is Object-based: i.e. allows you to upload files. Object-based storage only (for files)
 - **Not suitable to install an operating system or running a database on**
 - Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB
 - There is unlimited storage
 - Files are stored in Buckets
 - S3 is a universal namesapce. That means names must be unique globally - Example: https://s3-us-east1-1.amazonaws.com/tier3aws
 - Two data consistency models for S3 
    - Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects
    - Eventual Consitency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propogate)
- S3 Storage Classes/Tiers:
    - S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)
    - S3-IA (durable, immediately available, infrequently accessed)
    - S3-One Zone IA: Same as IA. However, data is stored in a single Availability Zone only
    - S3-Reduced Redundancy Storage (data that is easily reproducible, such as thumbnames, etc)
    - Glacier - Archived data, where you can wait 3-5 hours before accessing
- Remember the core fundamentals of an S3 object:
    - Key (This is simply the name of the object)
    - Value (This is simply the data, which is made up of a sequence of bytes)
    - Version ID (Important for versioning)
    - Metadata (Data about the data your are storing)
    - Subresources - bucket-specific configuration:
        - Bucket Policies, Access Control Lists
        - Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
        - Transfer Acceleration
- Successful uploads will generate a HTTP 200 status code when you use the CLI or API
