# S3 Policies

- S3 Buckets are like a folder, a container for files you upload to S3
- All files are private by default
- You can use access control lists to make a file publicly available

- Two main mechanisms that control the access to your bucket
    - Access Control lists - control lists on a file or object basis
    - Bucket Policies - written in json and can be written using the policy generator (https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html)
