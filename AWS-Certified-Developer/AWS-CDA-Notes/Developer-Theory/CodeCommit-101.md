# CodeCommit
AWS CodeCommit
- Fully managed Source Control service that enables the companies to host secure and highly scalable private Git repositories
- Git is an industry-standard Open Source distributed source control system:
    - Centralized repository for all your code, binaries, images, and libraries
    - Tracks and manages code changes
    - Maintains version history
    - Manages updates from multiple sources
    - Enables collaboration
    
- Users create a copy (branch) of the master repository, which they can update independently without impacting other users
- Saved code changes which are ready to be applied to a repository are known as a commit
- When the updated code located in a branch is ready to be added to the master repository, the branch is then merged into the master repository
- AWS Code Commit provides all the functionality of Git and you can use Git on your local machine to interact with your CodeCommit repo
- Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest
