# IAM
- Manage users and manage level of access to the AWS Console

### IAM Gives you
- Centralized control of your AWS account
- Shared Access to your AWS account
- Granular Permissions
- Identity Federation (LinkedIn, Facebook, AD)
- Multi-factor Authentication
- Temporary access for users/devices and services

### Critical Terms
- Users - End user (think people)
- Groups - Collections of users under one set of permission (Marketing team needs permissions to read certain files in S3 bucket)
- Roles - you create roles and can then assign them AWS resources (used to define a set of permissions, example S3 bucket access - the role can be assumed by either users, AWS services xEC2)
- Policies - document that defines one or more permissions
  
### Roles

**Example Role Policy:**  
```json
{
	"Version": "2012-02-03",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "s3:*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```
  
- You can apply roles to an EC2 instance through the aws console
	- Actions -> Instance Settings -> Attach/Replace IAM Role
  
### What weâ€™ve learned

- IAM Consists of the following:
	- Users
	- Groups ( a way to group our users and apply policies to them collectively)
	- Roles
	- Policy Documents
	- The root account is simply the account created when first setup AWS account. It has complete Admin access
	- New users have no permissions when first crated
	- New users are assigned access key id & secret access keys when first created
	- These are not the same as password, and you cannot use the Access key ID & Secret Access key to login to the AWS Management Console
	- You can use the Access keys via the APIs, and command line.
	- You only get to view the access key and secret access key once. Save them in secure location
	- Always setup multi-factor Authentication on your root account.
  
### Exam Tips
- Roles allow you to not use Acess Key ID's and Secret Access Keys
- Roles are preferred from a security perspective
	- Choice between Access keys or Roles **always choose roles**
- Roles are controlled by policies
- You can change a policy on a role and it will take immediate affect
- You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate these instances
