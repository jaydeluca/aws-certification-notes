# Notes from Several Practice Exams

I separated these into the different pillars of the Well-Architected Framework for better readability.

[Design Resilient Architectures](Design-Resilient-Architectures.md)
[Design Performance Architectures](Design-Performance-Architectures.md)
[Design Cost-optimized Architectures](Design-Cost-Optimized-Architectures.md)
[Define Operationally Excellent Architectures](Define-Operationally-Excellent-Architectures.md)

All are pulled from various questions from different practice exams.

Please add/correct wherever necessary
